description: Isabella Lilias Trotter (1853-1928) was an artist and a missionary for
  over 38 years to the Muslims of Algeria. John Ruskin, the famous art critic, didn't
  believe that ladies could paint before he met Lilias. He changed his mind after
  he met her and believed that if she would give her life to painting she could become
  the greatest painter of the nineteenth century. Ruskin believed that if she would
  devote herself to art ""she would be the greatest living painter and do things that
  would be immortal. "" He was unhappy that she was spending so much time on the streets
  of London.
